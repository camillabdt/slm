Component deployment diagram.\nC. Sequence of unit test assertions.\nD. Database physical schema DDL.\nE. Network routing table.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Use cases model interactions between actors and the system; the others are design, test, or infrastructure artifacts."}
{"text": "Question (Stem): Which practice supports bidirectional traceability in RE?\nA. Linking each requirement to its tests and design elements.\nB. Only keeping user stories in a spreadsheet.\nC. Relying on developers’ memory for links.\nD. Deleting outdated backlog items without records.\nE. Merging test and production configurations.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Traceability requires explicit links among requirements, design, code and tests; ad-hoc practices are insufficient."}
{"text": "Question (Stem): What is the main purpose of prioritization techniques such as MoSCoW?\nA. Decide which requirements to implement first under constraints.\nB. Validate database referential integrity.\nC. Measure code coverage of unit tests.\nD. Generate production deployment plans.\nE.

Clarifying acceptance criteria before development starts.\nC. Removing a low-value feature during grooming.\nD. Refining an existing user story for clarity.\nE. Fixing a defect found during review.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Scope creep is uncontrolled expansion without adjusting constraints; the other actions are controlled process steps."}
{"text": "Question (Stem): Which attribute improves requirement quality according to best practices?\nA. Being unambiguous, testable, and measurable.\nB. Containing multiple goals in one sentence.\nC. Using vague terms like 'fast' and 'user-friendly'.\nD. Mixing design decisions into the requirement.\nE. Referring to undocumented external knowledge.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: High-quality requirements are clear, verifiable and measurable; the other options reduce clarity or testability."}
{"text": "Question (Stem): In user stories, which part corresponds to the business value?\nA. So that <benefit>\nB. As a <role>\nC. I want <capability>\nD. Given <context>\nE. Then <outcome>\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: The 'so that' clause states the reason/benefit; role and capability give context and intent, not value itself."}
{"text": "Question (Stem): Which elicitation technique is most suitable for uncovering tacit knowledge of domain experts?\nA. In-depth interviews and observation.\nB. Automated static code analysis.\nC. Public API rate limiting.\nD. Container orchestration with Kubernetes.\nE. Randomized A/B testing of UI colors.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Tacit knowledge is best captured via interviews/observation; the other options are unrelated to elicitation."}
{"text": "Question (Stem): Which document formalizes the approved set of requirements at a point in time?\nA. Requirements baseline.\nB. Incident response plan.\nC. Disaster recovery runbook.\nD. Continuous delivery playbook.\nE. Network access policy.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: A baseline is the approved snapshot against which changes are controlled."}
{"text": "Question (Stem): Which factor is MOST critical when defining acceptance criteria for a requirement?\nA. Testability with objective pass/fail conditions.\nB. Developer preference for a specific framework.\nC. Availability of staging hardware.\nD. Choice of code formatting style.\nE. Vendor contract terms for licenses.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Acceptance criteria must allow objective verification; the other factors are peripheral."}
{"text": "Question (Stem): Which is the BEST description of a stakeholder in RE?\nA. Anyone who affects or is affected by the system.\nB. Only the paying sponsor of the project.\nC. Only end users who log into the product.\nD. Only the legal department.\nE. Only developers assigned to the project.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Stakeholders include anyone impacted or influential, beyond users or sponsors alone."}
{"text": "Question (Stem): Which technique can reduce ambiguity in NFRs like performance?\nA. Defining measurable thresholds (e.g., p95 latency < 300 ms).\nB. Saying the system should be 'fast enough'.\nC. Leaving performance for post-release tuning.\nD. Letting developers choose test data ad hoc.\nE. Using subjective developer surveys.\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Measurable thresholds make NFRs testable; vague or deferred approaches increase ambiguity."}
